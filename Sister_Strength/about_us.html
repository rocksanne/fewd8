                <p class="body-copy">Sister Strength exists to support women of all ages and to be united in love. (Colossians 2:2) To realize that they aren't alone when dealing with various life changing issues. (Romans 15:1, 20)
                    <br>We will strive to accomplish this by:
                    <ul class="body-copy">
                        <li>Developing a support system; offering encouragement to one another. (Hebrews 10: 24-25)</li>

                        <li>Encouraging others to trust the Lord.</li>
                        <li>To grow in faith.</li>
                        <li>Obtain a positive image of themselves.</li>
                        <li>Develop a personal relationship with the Lord through prayer, studying the word and fasting.</li>

                        <br>Together we uplift and encourage one another through trials
                        <br>and tribulations, through the good and the bad in our lives.
                        <br>Together we cast our burdens to the Lord.
                        <br>Together we walk in faith.
                        <br>Together we fast and pray for deliverance.
                        <br>Together we remind one another that God is in control in our lives.
                        <br>We trust God for all things in our lives.<br>   
                        <br>While growing in power, for the love of God in me, we are sisters standing together in unity and blessing my sisters.<br><br>
